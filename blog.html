        <!-- Question 01 -->

        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold pb-5"><u>Question 01:</u> Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h1>
        <div class="lg:ml-10 ml-4">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold pb-3"><u>Var:</u></h3>
            <p class="text-xl mb-4 lg:ml-10 ml-5">Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled. There are issues
                associated with variables declared with var, though. That is why it was necessary for new ways to
                declare variables to emerge. First, let's get to understand var more before we discuss those issues.</p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold pb-3"><u>Scope of var:</u></h3>
            <p class="text-xl mb-7 lg:ml-10 ml-5">var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped.

                The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that any variable
                that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window.

                var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be
                accessed only within that function.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold pb-3"><u>Let:</u></h3>
            <p class="text-xl mb-4 lg:ml-10 ml-5">let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it
                comes as an improvement to var declarations. It also solves the problem with var that we just covered.
                Let's consider why this is so..</p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold pb-3"><u>Scope of Let:</u></h3>
            <p class="text-xl mb-7 lg:ml-10 ml-5">A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly
                braces. Anything within curly braces is a block.

                So a variable declared in a block with let is only available for use within that block.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold pb-3"><u>Const:</u></h3>
            <p class="text-xl mb-4 lg:ml-10 ml-5">Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const
                declarations share some similarities with let declarations.</p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold pb-3"><u>Scope of Const:</u></h3>
            <p class="text-xl mb-10 lg:ml-10 ml-5">Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within
                the block they were declared.

                Const cannot be updated or re-declared.
                This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains the same within its scope. It cannot
                be updated or re-declared. So if we declare a variable with const, we can neither do this:</p>

        <!-- question 02 -->
        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold pb-5 pt-5"><u>Question 02:</u> Tell us the use cases of <span
                class="text-green-400">Null</span> and <span class="text-green-400"> Undefined</span></h1>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold pb-3"><u>Undefined</u></h3>
        <p class="text-xl pb-4">Undefined is a primitive data type that represents a variable that has been declared but
            has not been assigned a value. It's important to note that `undefined` is not the same as "not-defined"it's
            a specific value that a variable can have. </p>
        <p class="text-xl pb-3">Here are some common use cases for undefined:</p>
        <ol class="list-decimal lg:ml-40">
            <li class="pb-3 text-lg"><span class="text-xl font-semibold">Variable Initialization:</span><br>Variable
                Initialization: When you declare a variable without assigning an initial value to it, it is
                automatically initialized to `Undefined`.
            </li>

            <li class="pb-3 text-lg"><span class="text-xl font-semibold">Function Parameters:</span><br>If a function is
                called with fewer arguments than declared in its parameter list, the missing arguments are set to
                `Undefined`.</li>

            <li class="pb-3 text-lg"><span class="text-xl font-semibold">Return Value</span><br>If a function doesn't
                explicitly return a value, it implicitly returns `Undefined`.</li>

            <li class="pb-3 text-lg"><span class="text-xl font-semibold">Accessing Non-Existent Object
                    Properties:</span><br> When you try to access a property of an object that doesn't exist, JavaScript
                returns `Undefined`.</li>

            <li class="pb-3 text-lg"><span class="text-xl font-semibold">Array Elements:</span><br> If you try to access
                an array element at an index that is out of range, it returns `Undefined`.</li>

            <li class="pb-3 text-lg"><span class="text-xl font-semibold">Optional Function Parameters:</span><br>When
                using optional function parameters, you can check if an argument is `Undefined` and provide a default
                value.</li>

            <li class="pb-3 text-lg"><span class="text-xl font-semibold">Array Elements:</span><br>Accessing an index
                that is out of bounds in an array will return `Undefined`.</li>

        </ol>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold pb-3 pt-10"><u>Null</u></h3>
        <p class="text-xl pb-4">Null is a special value that represents the intentional absence of any object value or a
            placeholder for an expected object value that is not yet available. </p>

        <p class="text-xl pb-3">It is often used in specific use cases,which given below:</p>

        <ol class="list-decimal lg:ml-40 pb-10">
            <li class="pb-3 text-lg"><span class="text-xl font-semibold">Initializing Variables:</span><br>You can
                initialize a variable to null when you want to explicitly indicate that it has no value, but you expect
                it to hold an object value later in the program.</li>

            <li class="pb-3 text-lg"><span class="text-xl font-semibold">Resetting or Clearing Values:</span><br>Setting
                a variable to null is a common way to clear or reset it, especially when you want to release memory
                resources associated with an object.</li>


            <li class="pb-3 text-lg"><span class="text-xl font-semibold">Function Return Values:</span><br>Functions may
                return `null` to indicate that they didn't find a valid result or encountered an error.</li>

            <li class="pb-3 text-lg"><span class="text-xl font-semibold">Object Properties:</span><br>Object properties
                can be set to `null` to indicate that a certain property is intentionally empty or doesn't have a value
                yet.</li>


            <li class="pb-3 text-lg"><span class="text-xl font-semibold">Checking for Missing Values:</span><br>You can
                use null to check if a value is missing or uninitialized, especially when you want to distinguish
                between missing and defined values.</li>

            <li class="pb-3 text-lg"><span class="text-xl font-semibold">Default Values:</span><br>null can be used as a
                default value when you want to initialize variables or object properties and intend to set them to a
                different value later.</li>

        </ol>



        <!-- question 03 -->
        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold pb-5"><u>Question 03:</u> What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold pb-5 "><u> Api</u></h3>
        <p class="text-xl mb-10 lg:ml-10 ml-5">An API for a website is code that allows two software programs to
            communicate with each other. The API spells out the proper way for a developer to write a program requesting
            services from an operating system or other application.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold pb-5 "><u>Rest Api</u></h3>
        <p class="text-xl mb-10 lg:ml-10 ml-5">A Rest API is an architectural style for an application program interface
            (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE
            data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold pb-5 "><u>More About Rest Api</u></h3>
        <p class="text-xl mb-10 lg:ml-10 ml-5">A REST API -- also referred to as a RESTful web service or REST API -- is
            based on representational state transfer (REST), which is an architectural style and approach to
            communications often used in web services development.

            REST technology is generally preferred over other similar technologies. This tends to be the case because
            REST uses less bandwidth, making it more suitable for efficient internet usage. RESTful APIs can also be
            built with programming languages such as JavaScript or Python.</p>


        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold pb-5 "><u>How Rest Api works</u></h3>
        <p class="text-xl mb-10 lg:ml-10 ml-5">A RESTful API breaks down a transaction to create a series of small
            modules. Each module addresses an underlying part of the transaction. This modularity provides developers
            with a lot of flexibility, but it can be challenging for developers to design their REST API from scratch.
            Currently, several companies provide models for developers to use; the models provided by Amazon S3, Cloud
            Data Management Interface (CDMI) and OpenStack Swift are the most popular.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold pb-5 "><u>REST API HTTP Method</u></h3>
        <p class="text-xl mb-10 lg:ml-10 ml-5">A RESTful API uses existing HTTP methodologies defined by the RFC 2616
            protocol, such as: <br>

            1.GET to retrieve a resource; <br>
            2.PUT to change the state of or update a resource, which can be an object, file or block; <br>
            3.POST to create that resource; and <br>
            4.DELETE to remove it.</p>
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold pb-5 "><u>REST API Data Formats Support</u></h3>
        <p class="text-xl mb-10 lg:ml-10 ml-5">
            1. application/json <br>
            2. application/xml<br>
            3. application/x-wbe+xml<br>
            4. application/x-www-form-urlencoded<br>
            5. multipart/form-data

                    Discuss the scope of var, let, and const

                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p><span class="text-black font bold text-lg">Ans:</span> var, let, and const are three different
                        ways to declare variables in JavaScript, and they
                        have different scopes and behaviors</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        <span class="text-black font-bold text-lg">Scope of var:</span> var declarations are globally
                        scoped or function/locally scoped. The scope is
                        global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that any variable that is
                        declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window. var is
                        function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can
                        be accessed only within that function.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> <span class="text-black font-bold text-lg">Scope of Let:</span> A block is a chunk of code
                        bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within curly
                        braces is a block. So a variable declared in a block with let is only available for use within
                        that block.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><span class="text-black font-bold text-lg">Scope of Const:</span> Like let declarations, const
                        declarations can only be accessed within the block they were
                        declared. Const cannot be updated or re-declared. This means that the value of a variable
                        declared with const remains the same within its scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared. So
                        if we declare a variable with const, we can neither do this:</p>

                    <p> <span class="text-orange-400 font-bold text-lg">Null:</span> Null is a special value that
                        represents the intentional absence of any object value or a
                        placeholder for an expected object value that is not yet available.</p>

                    <p> <span class="text-orange-400 font-bold text-lg">Undefined:</span> Undefined is a primitive data
                        type that represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It's
                        important to note that `undefined` is not the same as "not-defined"it's a specific value that a
                        variable can have.</p>

                    <p>A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of
                        architectural principles for designing networked applications. It uses standard HTTP methods and
                        URLs to allow clients to interact with resources on a server in a stateless and scalable
                        manner.A Rest API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses
                        HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data
                        types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning
                        resources.</p>

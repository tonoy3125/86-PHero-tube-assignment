                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p><span class="text-black font bold text-lg">Ans:</span> var, let, and const are three different
                        ways to declare variables in JavaScript, and they
                        have different scopes and behaviors</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        <span class="text-black font-bold text-lg">Scope of var:</span> var declarations are globally
                        scoped or function/locally scoped. The scope is
                        global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that any variable that is
                        declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window. var is
                        function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can
                        be accessed only within that function.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> <span class="text-black font-bold text-lg">Scope of Let:</span> A block is a chunk of code
                        bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within curly
                        braces is a block. So a variable declared in a block with let is only available for use within
                        that block.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><span class="text-black font-bold text-lg">Scope of Const:</span> Like let declarations, const
                        declarations can only be accessed within the block they were
                        declared. Const cannot be updated or re-declared. This means that the value of a variable
                        declared with const remains the same within its scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared. So
                        if we declare a variable with const, we can neither do this:</p>

                    => Tell us the use cases of Null and Undefined
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p> <span class="text-orange-400 font-bold text-lg">Null:</span> Null is a special value that
                        represents the intentional absence of any object value or a placeholder for an expected object
                        value that is not yet available.The use cases of Null is -
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="font-bold">Initializing Variables:</span>
                        You can initialize a variable to null when you want to explicitly indicate that it has no value,
                        but you expect it to hold an object value later in the program.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="font-bold">Resetting or Clearing Values:</span>
                        Setting a variable to null is a common way to clear or reset it, especially when you want to
                        release memory resources associated with an object.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="font-bold">Function Return Values:</span>
                        Functions may return `null` to indicate that they didn't find a valid result or encountered an
                        error.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="font-bold">Object Properties:</span>
                        Object properties can be set to `null` to indicate that a certain property is intentionally
                        empty or doesn't have a value yet.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="font-bold">Checking for Missing Values:</span>
                        You can use null to check if a value is missing or uninitialized, especially when you want to
                        distinguish between missing and defined values.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="font-bold">Default Values:</span>
                        null can be used as a default value when you want to initialize variables or object properties
                        and intend to set them to a different value later.
                    </p>

                    <p> <span class="text-orange-400 font-bold text-lg">Undefined:</span> Undefined is a primitive data
                        type that represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It's
                        important to note that `undefined` is not the same as "not-defined"it's a specific value that a
                        variable can have.The use cases of Undefined is -

                        <span class="font-bold">Variable Initialization:</span>
                        When you declare a variable without assigning an initial value to it,
                        it is automatically initialized to `Undefined`.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="font-bold">Function Parameters:</span>
                        If a function is called with fewer arguments than declared in its parameter list, the missing
                        arguments are set to `Undefined`.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="font-bold">Return Value:</span>
                        If a function doesn't explicitly return a value, it implicitly returns `Undefined`.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="font-bold">Accessing Non-Existent Object Properties:</span>
                        When you try to access a property of an object that doesn't exist, JavaScript returns
                        `Undefined`.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="font-bold">Array Elements:</span>
                        If you try to access an array element at an index that is out of range, it returns `Undefined`.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="font-bold">Optional Function Parameters:</span>
                        When using optional function parameters, you can check if an argument is `Undefined` and provide
                        a default value.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="font-bold">Array Elements:</span>
                        Accessing an index that is out of bounds in an array will return `Undefined`.

                        architectural principles for designing networked applications. It uses standard HTTP methods and
                        URLs to allow clients to interact with resources on a server in a stateless and scalable
                        manner.A Rest API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses
                        HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data
